## Using candlestick charts to identify network anomalies in timeseries data

The aim of this project is to identify anomalies and outliers inside a time series, using candlestick charts.
The forecasting algorithm has been based on (double) exponential moving average.
Monitoring the three main candle values (open value, close value, and volume) allows us to find anomalies even in
noisy datasets.
***
### How does the algorithm work?

This project implements simple and double exponential smoothing functions to forecast time series values.
